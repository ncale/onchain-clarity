			</p>
			<p>
				Blockchains are inherently open canvases, allowing anyone to 
				interact with the same core base of information and build a consistent
				identity through time. However, modern user experience doesn&apos;t reflect 
				this - social platforms are isolated, identity is often ambiguous, and our thesis
				is this lack of connectivity frequently impacts how we behave.
			</p>
			<p>
				Onchain Clarity Co., through our various projects, strives to bring blockchain to 
				life. Using some of the many large and growing social protocols, such as 
				Farcaster, ENS, and more, we can piece together a more wholistic picture of
				what the network is up to, starting by surfacing more of your connections to other
				people.
